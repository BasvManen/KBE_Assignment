800.		# span of the main plate [mm]
300. 		# chord of the main plate [mm]
15. 		# downward inclination of the main plate [deg]

# Strut Inputs
False		# Bool to specify struts shape. True for airfoil shape, False for a simple filleted plate.
0.5		# placement of the struts on the main plate in terms of fraction of the semi span of the main plate.
300.		# height of the struts [mm]
0.7		# chord of the struts as a fraction of the main plate chord
5. 		# thickness of the struts [mm]
15.		# sweepback angle of the struts [deg]
